write code for a games tournament landing page in html css and js
the page will be simple one screen only scrolling one level. it would have a text in the middle
of the screen saying "Welcome, are you the Very Best?" and 2 buttons underneath one that says sign up here
this button pops up a form with the fields Name, team handle/username, contact info (whatsapp)
the second will have a link imbeded to join a telegram group
there should also be a counter that shows the number of slots remaining beginning at 32 and with each
registration it reduces till it reaches 0 when it will say registration closed for this event and it will
pop up another form that has the fields, Name, games interested in(this is a checklist with fifa, COD, PUBG, MK11 on it)
and contact information (whatsapp)



below the first section, like a paralax effect, there should be a tournament bracket which randomly puts in those who registered 
for the tournament and keeps updating until it is done. let the countdown be here just above it

for the background colour of the page use this #232946
for the text, Welcome, use pixel style text them space grotesk fro the rest


make it look good
